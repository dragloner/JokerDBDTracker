# JokerDBDTracker v1.2.3.1

Patch release focused on player UX, presets workflow, and UI polish.

## Included changes

- Built-in presets reworked (same names, more diverse visual/audio combinations).
- Presets tab no longer auto-switches to Effects after apply/load.
- Slider visuals reworked (thumb/track redesign, ongoing artifact reduction work).
- Additional embedded YouTube startup layout-repair logic.
